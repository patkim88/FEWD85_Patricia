  <section class="about-me">
    <p>
      Patricia was born at the now defunct St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan during the Blizzard of '88. Her father broke several laws driving her mother from Queens to Manhattan. Her birth and her life have been one wild ride!
    </p>
    <p>
      She attended Stony Brook University intending to major in biochemistry but ended up dropping the her second semester because calculus sucks. She decided to channel her passion for the written word into a totally real life application and switched her
      major to English with the intention of writing the next ‘Great American Novel’.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduation she had a revelation that an English major provided no real life skills and joined the teeming masses of unemployed liberal arts majors.

      Cue spiraling depression and maxed out credit cards.
    </p>

      Eventually she landed at job at SAP where she stayed for two years. Today she works at an ATS/CRM software company as a business analyst and has paid off her credit card debt.
