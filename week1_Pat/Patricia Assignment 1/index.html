  <section class="about-me">
    <p>
      Patricia was born at the now defunct St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan during the Blizzard of '88. Her father broke several laws driving her mother from Queens to Manhattan. Her birth and her life have been one wild ride!
    </p>
    <p>
      She attended Stony Brook University intending to major in biochemistry but ended up dropping the major her second semester because calculus sucks. She decided to channel her passion for the written word into a totally real life application and switched her major to English with the intention of writing the next ‘Great American Novel’.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduation she had a revelation that an English major provided no real life skills and that novels were difficult to write than she expected it to be. She was unable to find gainful employment and she joined the teeming masses of unemployed liberal arts majors.
